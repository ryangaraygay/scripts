Override the ==highlight== background color without changing the theme's actual CSS file
Also added some padding around the text so doesnt "hug" the highlight borders and rounded them slightly too
Location to place this CSS file can be found in Settings > Appearance > CSS Snippets (at the bottom)
Usually it would be in /<Obsidian Vault Location>/.obsidian/snippets/
